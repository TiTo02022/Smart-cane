# Smart Cane Prototype

The code and documentation for a prototype of an Arduino-powered smart cane are available in this repository. The smart cane has an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distances between it and nearby obstacles; it uses a motor to vibrate haptically when an obstacle is detected within a certain range; and it uses a buzzer to generate an audible alert when an obstacle is detected.

## Features

- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures distances from the smart cane to objects in its path.
- **Motor**: Provides tactile feedback through vibrations to alert the user of nearby obstacles.
- **Buzzer**: Emits an audible sound to notify the user when an obstacle is detected within range.

## Components

- Arduino uno
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Vibration motor
- Buzzer
- Jumper wires
- 9V battery 

## Usage

1. Power on the smart cane using the designated power source.
2. Hold the cane in front of you while walking.
3. When an obstacle is detected within the specified range, the motor will vibrate, and the buzzer will emit a sound.
